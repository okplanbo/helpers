# Helpers

A tiny project I did ages ago. It helped me and some of my friends with routine tasks.

## Features

- Static HTML5 template
- Handful of Bootstrap 3 classes
- A little bit of jquery 3 to make magic happen
- Mobile friendliness
- What else do you need..? :-)

Using it as my zen garden and updating from time to time.
